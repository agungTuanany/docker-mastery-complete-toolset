First we're going to discuss the basic of images and the concepts that you're
going to need.

What is actually in an image and, just as _importantly_, **what isn't in an image**.

We're going to talk a little bit about how to find images on the internet and
we'll actually go and look at some, dive into that whole process to finding good
images and how to manage those image once we've downloaded them or created them
on our won machines.

We'll jump into the fun part of making our own images.

## What is in An Image

So before we start playing with images and learning how to use them for
containers, we probably want to step into **what exactly is in an image** and
**what isn't**. The way I like to explain is very simple.

Images is the application binaries and dependencies for your app and the
metadata on how to run it.

The official definition, "image is an ordered collection of root filesystem
changes and the corresponding execution parameters for use within a container
runtime", [image definition](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/image/spec/v1.md)
